# MOOC Introduction to Open Data Science 2019: Homework4

## Step1. Check the Boston dataset
##### View the dataset
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(MASS)
head(Boston, n=15)
```
##### View the dataset structure
```{r}
str(Boston)
```
>
The Boston dataset is aiming to see the housing values in suburbs of Boston which includes 14 variables and 506 rows and it contains the following columns:
>
* crim: per capita crime rate by town.
* zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
* chas: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
* nox: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
* rm: average number of rooms per dwelling.
* age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
* dis: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
* rad: index of accessibility to radial highways.
* tax: full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.
* ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* black: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
* lstat: lower status of the population (percent).
* medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s.

##### Graphical overview
Check the correlations between variables via correlation matrix plot.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor(Boston), type="upper")
```

> 
If the relationship between two variables are more related, the circle would be more bigger and darker. According to the size and color of the circles, we can observe that those variables are related as following: 
>
* crim: rad, tax
* zn: dis, age, indus
* indus: nox, dis, tax
* chas: N/A
* nox: age, dis, tax
* rm: latat, medv
* age: dis, lstat
* dis: rad, tax, lstat
* rad: tax
* tax: lstat
* ptratio: medv
* black: crim, rad, tax...
* lstat: rm, age...
* medv: rm

Summary Boston dataset
```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(Boston)
```
##### Standardize the dataset
```{r, echo = FALSE}
Boston_scale <- scale(Boston, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
head(Boston_scale)
summary(Boston_scale)
```
##### Create a categorical variable of the crime rate in the Boston dataset (from the scaled crime rate)
p.s. Use the quantiles as the break points in the categorical variable
```{r}
# class of the boston_scaled object
class(Boston_scale)
Boston_scale <- as.data.frame(Boston_scale)

# create a quantile vector of crim and print it
bins <- quantile(Boston_scale$crim)
bins

# create a categorical variable 'crime'
crime <- cut(Boston_scale$crim, breaks = bins, include.lowest = TRUE)
table(crime)

# remove original crim from the dataset
Boston_scale <- dplyr::select(Boston_scale, -crim)

# add the new categorical value to scaled data
Boston_scale <- data.frame(Boston_scale, crime)
```
##### Divide the dataset to train and test sets, so that 80% of the data belongs to the train set
```{r}
# number of rows in the Boston dataset 
n <- nrow(Boston_scale)

# choose randomly 80% of the rows
ind <- sample(n,  size = n * 0.8)

# create train set
train <- Boston_scale[ind,]

# create test set 
test <- Boston_scale[-ind,]

# save the correct classes from test data
correct_classes <- Boston_scale[-ind,]$crime

# remove the crime variable from test data
test <- dplyr::select(test, -crime)
```

##### Fit the linear discriminant analysis on the train set
- Use the categorical crime rate as the target variable and all the other variables in the dataset as predictor variables. Draw the LDA (bi)plot.
- Save the crime categories from the test set and then remove the categorical crime variable from the test dataset
```{r}
# linear discriminant analysis
lda.fit <- lda(crime~., data = train)

# print the lda.fit object
lda.fit

# the function for lda biplot arrows
lda.arrows <- function(x, myscale = 1, arrow_heads = 0.1, color = "red", tex = 0.75, choices = c(1,2)){
  heads <- coef(x)
  arrows(x0 = 0, y0 = 0, 
         x1 = myscale * heads[,choices[1]], 
         y1 = myscale * heads[,choices[2]], col=color, length = arrow_heads)
  text(myscale * heads[,choices], labels = row.names(heads), 
       cex = tex, col=color, pos=3)
}

# target classes as numeric
classes <- as.numeric(train$crime)

# plot the lda results
plot(lda.fit, dimen = 2)
lda.arrows(lda.fit, myscale = 1)
```

##### Predict the classes with the LDA model on the test data. Cross tabulate the results with the crime categories from the test set. Comment on the results.
```{r}
# predict classes with test data
lda.pred <- predict(lda.fit, newdata = test)

# cross tabulate the results
table(correct = correct_classes, predicted = lda.pred$class)
```

##### Reload the Boston dataset and standardize the dataset 
- Calculate the distances between the observations. Run k-means algorithm on the dataset. Investigate what is the optimal number of clusters and run the algorithm again. 
- Visualize the clusters. For example with the pairs() or ggpairs() functions, where the clusters are separated with colors and interpret the results
```{r}
library(MASS)
data('Boston')

# scale the dataset
bs <- scale(Boston)
bs <- as.data.frame(bs)

# distance measure 1: euclidean distance matrix
dist_eu <- dist(bs, method = "euclidean")

# look at the summary of the distances
summary(dist_eu)

# distance measure 2: manhattan distance matrix
dist_man <- dist(bs, method = "manhattan")

# look at the summary of the distances
summary(dist_man)

# k-means clustering
# plot the Boston dataset with clusters
km <-kmeans(bs, centers = 4)
pairs(bs[6:10], col = km$cluster)

# k-means clustering
km <-kmeans(bs, centers = 3)
pairs(bs[6:10], col = km$cluster)

# k-means clustering
km <-kmeans(bs, centers = 2)
pairs(bs[6:10], col = km$cluster)

# k-means clustering
km <-kmeans(bs, centers = 1)
pairs(bs[6:10], col = km$cluster)

```
As shown in the k-means graph above (from center=4 to 1), the pair graph with center=2 seems the most resonable seperation. In the graph when center=3, some cluster are ambiguous winthin one group. 

##### Bonus
- Perform k-means on the original Boston data with some reasonable number of clusters (> 2). 
- Perform LDA using the clusters as target classes. Include all the variables in the Boston data in the LDA model. 
```{r}
Boston_scale_original <- scale(Boston)
Boston_scale_original <- as.data.frame(Boston_scale_original)

# k-means clustering
km_original <-kmeans(Boston_scale_original, centers = 4)
pairs(Boston_scale_original[6:10], col = km_original$cluster)
# k-means clustering
km_original <-kmeans(Boston_scale_original, centers = 3)
pairs(Boston_scale_original[6:10], col = km_original$cluster)



```

##### Visualize the results with a biplot (include arrows representing the relationships of the original variables to the LDA solution). 
Interpret the results. Which variables are the most influencial linear separators for the clusters? (0-2 points to compensate any loss of points from the above exercises)
```{r}

```

##### Super-Bonus
Run the code below for the (scaled) train data that you used to fit the LDA. The code creates a matrix product, which is a projection of the data points.
```{r}

```
